# React-Project-Animania

**AniMania** is web system for pet lovers. The app is with Bulgarian interface.

**There are two types of users:**
-	**Registered users** – can add, edit and delete pet articles and jokes, can add comments to the articles, can like other players' articles and jokes
-	**Guest users** – can browse through articles, comments and jokes, can register
- everybody can see the number of comments and likes


**Next steps** (will be implemented soon):
-	**Registered users** – can add, edit and delete offers, can add comments other players' offers
-	**Migration to Firebase** – i plan change the authentication system and database to Firebase Auth and Firebase Realtime Database, also use Firebase cloud storage for uploading images



**Test accounts**: the app is working with the [softuni-practice-server](https://github.com/softuni-practice-server/softuni-practice-server) so it can be tested with the accounts provided by the practice server : peter@abv.bg and george@abv.bg with pass 123456, or just create own account



**Technology stack:**
-	React: v17.0.2,
-   React-bootstrap: v2.0.3,
-   React-router-dom: v6.1.0,
-	For DB and authentication - softuni-practice-server
-	Icons - Font-awsome





# Documentation Create React App follows below
**********************************************

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
